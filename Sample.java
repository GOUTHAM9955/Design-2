/*
Time Complexity:
 Push: O(1)
 Pop: O(1)
 Peek: Average Time Complexity
    My understanding: Even though we need to transfer n elements for the 1st fill from support to original stack
    as original stack is empty. For the following series of operations we don't copy until original stack is empty
    and the same operation is used over the series.

 Space Complexity: O(n)
